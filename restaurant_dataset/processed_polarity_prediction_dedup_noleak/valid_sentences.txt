The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food &apos;s presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
Great sushi experience .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ....
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
The Pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , I &apos;ve had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
We only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( don &apos;t waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good !
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food doesn &apos;t quite match up .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
It &apos;s a nice place to relax and have conversation .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
Thank You Emilio .
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion .. try the potato stuff kanish best one .
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
The people with carts of food don &apos;t understand you because they don &apos;t speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
Also , don &apos;t plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it &apos;s not on the menu , you can &apos;t have it .
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef &apos;s special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
Any if you have a reservation you &apos;ll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar .
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
Try the sea bass .
Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12 @-@ 14 entrees .
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
Because we didn &apos;t have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
DO not try unless you &apos;re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto @-@ yum ! ) .
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- I dont mind .
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don &apos;t skimp .
I &apos;ve had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
Whether it &apos;s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
Food and service was okay .
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .
I &apos;ve had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer .
It won &apos;t break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food .
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation @-@ Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest .
We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .
All of my co @-@ workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn &apos;t heard about this place .
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you &apos;ll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you &apos;re in .
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
limited menu , no @-@ so @-@ fresh ingredients , thinly @-@ sliced fish , fall @-@ apart rice .
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
The food was great .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price can &apos;t be beat ! ! !
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d &apos; apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .
The food &apos;s as good as ever .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d &apos; apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn &apos;t even fully melted !
The cuisine from what I &apos;ve gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I &apos;ve been accustomed to in Taipei .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
I won &apos;t go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
If you &apos;re not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don &apos;t accept credit cards .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef &apos;s special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good !
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .
It &apos;s boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
The place wasn &apos;t too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz &apos;s Deli down on the Lower East Side .
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
Every course was better than the next .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un @-@ appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !
I was back @-@ to @-@ back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
The food was exceptional .
Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x .
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) .
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .
Decor is charming .
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x .
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever @-@ changing menu keep us coming back .
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .
We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
I was with a party of 7 ( close but not next the the front doors ) and we were eating with our coats on .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
After the main course came , we didn &apos;t see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad @-@ looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping &apos;s are clear as glass with healthy @-@ looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover &apos;s brunch .
Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .
First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt @-@ in @-@ your @-@ mouth experience ) .
the turkey burgers are scary !
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
The food is usually good but it certainly isn &apos;t a relaxing place to go .
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .
Great service , great food .
The decor is vibrant and eye @-@ pleasing with several semi @-@ private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
But don &apos;t ever order bacon late at nite ( either platter or in sandwiches , for that matter don &apos;t from any take out place ) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars .
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city .
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
Great food , great prices , great service .
The wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they &apos;re going to be in town .
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
I wasn &apos;t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that &apos;s the price you pay for a popular place .
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
The wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they &apos;re going to be in town .
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .
this is the best secret place in midtown &apos; , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .
Some baby pizzas get their wish .
The place &apos;s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ?
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top @-@ notch .
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
More important , the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo .
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle @-@ light , food @-@ quality and service overcompensate .
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you &apos;re in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply @-@ priced , generally friendly staff , and if you &apos;re a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ..... very Soho / Village / Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on Roosevelt Avenue !
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I couldn &apos;t help telling them that the food was horrible .
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside @-@ out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that &apos;s not just from the rice .
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , won &apos;t put your wallet out of commission .
There are much better places in NY with better prices .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
The specials are usually quite good too .
This place is so much fun .
And the food was fantastic .
If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .
We didn &apos;t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
For the quality of food , a little too expensive .
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .
The food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
And even with it &apos;s Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
My co @-@ workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just didn &apos;t know what the dish was supposed to taste like .
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
I absolutely love this place ! ! !
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take @-@ out pizza .
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
Their sake martini is wonderful .
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
Even if the food wasn &apos;t this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
My suggestion is to eat family style because you &apos;ll want to try the other dishes .
Has the chef and owner changed ? ? ?
The food was very good , but not very thai .
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
I went at 6 : 00 PM specifically for the pre @-@ theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .
I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .
They don &apos;t walk around with the trays of Dim Sum .
Little Tonino &apos;s is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over @-@ bearing or rushed .
The staff is very kind and well trained , they &apos;re fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt @-@ in @-@ your @-@ mouth experience ) .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .
They charge different prices all the time .
I take all my NYC guests to VT &apos;s .
Good bagels and good cream cheese .
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting / atmosphere a lot .
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( don &apos;t waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .
We ate here in March , 2006 and ordered the pre @-@ theatre 3 @-@ course dinner with wine flight .
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .
His wife Tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
Okay service .
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it &apos;s still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick .
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
go here for the drinks !
this is the best secret place in midtown &apos; , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .
If you go , try the marinara / arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm ..... everything is just delicious .
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
but the service was a bit slow .
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .
I have eaten there 3 @-@ 4 times and the food was always good .
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
Prices are in line .
Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I &apos;m willing to overlook it .
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
The wine list isn &apos;t great , and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno &apos;s down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .
The bruschetta and panini &apos;s are so yummy !
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ @-@ ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not @-@ so @-@ fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single @-@ handedly solved third world famine .
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we hadn &apos;t even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !
The pickles were great addition .
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .
I &apos;m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we &apos;re repeat customers .
This place is a great stop for great food .
I didn &apos;t expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom &apos;s , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel &apos;s a run for its money .
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well .
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
The service is awful--the last time I was there ( and I do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
The place is a lot of fun .
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
The music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as I did , I got a whiff of corriander .
They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
It &apos;s easy to get a table for a large group and you don &apos;t get hustled out .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
It &apos;s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well @-@ prepared .
It is set far from the small street it &apos;s on , and there is no traffic noise .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it &apos;s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you &apos;re into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz &apos; Deli , or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants .
I &apos;ve lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .
This is the BEST Shabu @-@ Shabu Restaurant in the Try @-@ State Area .
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality .
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
I would recommend Roxy &apos;s for that , but not for their food .
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter .
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off @-@ set by the pour @-@ your @-@ own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .
Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
Don &apos;t waste money on decor .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 3.00 in NYC .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn &apos;t a problem to get our table immediately .
The meat dishes were only so @-@ so .
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
The menu has lots of options : I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
The service was great as well .
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
Having discovered Ping &apos;s on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
Baluchi &apos;s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
All conveniently delivered right to the door .
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
The fried dumplings are GREAT !
The prices cannot be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste .
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !
The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter &apos;s Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
If you go , try the marinara / arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm ..... everything is just delicious .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu @-@ fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
They were such a rip @-@ off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15 @-@ 20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly @-@ ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch .
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .
When he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn &apos;t find tonic .
The staff is excellent , specjal : that girl behind the bar , european chic .
Whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were .
I &apos;d call it an &apos; italian dinner &apos; .
The menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious .
Don &apos;t judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner .
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
Jimmy &apos;s is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx .
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co @-@ workers or friends that you haven &apos;t seen in a while .
I &apos;m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
Always great service !
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
Very good service and very good prices .
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I &apos;ve had .
I care more about the food and ambience .
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5 : 30 on a week night without reservations .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
the food was undercooked @-@ the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers .
They forgot a sandwich , didn &apos;t include plastic forks , and didn &apos;t include pita with the hummus platter .
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
Then , get ripped on free box wine .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
I went at 6 : 00 PM specifically for the pre @-@ theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .
The place was nice and calm .
The dim sum is ok but doesn &apos;t taste that fresh , and the little dishes don &apos;t look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
The service is descent even when this small place is packed .
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef &apos;s passion ( and kitchen &apos;s precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .
Behind this counter , two men are squeezed in .
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you &apos;re in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply @-@ priced , generally friendly staff , and if you &apos;re a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ..... very Soho / Village / Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on Roosevelt Avenue !
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
This place is great .
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise ( which isn &apos;t actually that bad ) , I mean please , who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic ?
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin @-@ crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I &apos;d never heard of before .
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced .
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu @-@ Shabu .
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting / atmosphere a lot .
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
Good bagels and good cream cheese .
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co @-@ workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .
Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert .
Good luck getting a table .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart &apos;s for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
Upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .
The service is fantastic .
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
Next time , we wouldn &apos;t dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list .
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
Dessert is a joke ... dont bother
All my co @-@ workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi wasn &apos;t fresh .
The food was authentic .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand @-@ crafted beers .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .
Great food , great lay out and awesome service .
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you &apos;ll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you &apos;re in .
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .
I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn &apos;t as good .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
When you &apos;re sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand @-@ painted high ceiling ) you &apos;d never know there was a world outside .
