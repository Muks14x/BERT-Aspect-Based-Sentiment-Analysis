Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .

I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .

I was very disappointed with this restaurant .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
Food was okay , nothing great .
Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .

The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could &apos;ve used a bit more salt ) .

Food @-@ awesome .
Service- friendly and attentive .

Don &apos;t judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
the food is decent .
however , it &apos;s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self @-@ respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
Food is great .
Service is top notch .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn &apos;t try to overpack the rice .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .

The service varys from day to day- sometimes they &apos;re very nice , and sometimes not .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don &apos;t .
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
If you &apos;ve ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .

The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I &apos;ve had at this price range .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
In any event , this is a place I &apos;ll be sure to stop by again when I &apos;m in this part of town .

Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but couldn &apos;t make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .

When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .

The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
We did tip , I guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .

I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza .

the turkey burgers are scary !
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .

The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .

Good , fast service .

The location is perfect .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .

As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid @-@ back late night in the city .

Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .

Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .

We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
One would think we &apos;d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter wouldn &apos;t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .

Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
Have the iced tea .
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
The worst excuse for Japanese food I &apos;ve ever encountered .
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you &apos;ll love it here .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single @-@ handedly solved third world famine .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
Don &apos;t waste money on decor .
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not @-@ so @-@ little gem does , it amazing he &apos;s even able to remember a consistent but not @-@ so @-@ frequent visitor .

The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .
They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .

Still , any quibbles about the bill were off @-@ set by the pour @-@ your @-@ own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .

It &apos;s not mind @-@ blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt @-@ in @-@ your @-@ mouth experience ) .
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it &apos;s still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .

I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
For many people , this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic .

Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we hadn &apos;t ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .

You can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc .
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
The decor is vibrant and eye @-@ pleasing with several semi @-@ private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
Went there for an office lunch .

No refills on fountain drinks , though .
Wow over 100 beers to choose from .
Be careful of portions - they &apos;re HUGE .
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
Did I mention the wine ?
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan .

I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .

While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz &apos;s has a charm about it .
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .
Priced at upper intermediate range .

I don &apos;t know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn &apos;t try to overpack the rice .
They used shredded cheese on top !
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .

One would think we &apos;d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter wouldn &apos;t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .

We &apos;ve been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
The food is very good too but for the most part , it &apos;s just regular food , nothing special .
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .

When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald &apos;s , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .

This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !

The food was absolutely horrible !
Food doesn &apos;t appear to be cooked on premisis but there &apos;s a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
The people with carts of food don &apos;t understand you because they don &apos;t speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .

The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
We &apos;ve never had any problems with the staff but maybe we &apos;ve been lucky ?
Drinks way over priced .

The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .

I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef &apos;s special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .
The food was very good , but not very thai .
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food doesn &apos;t quite match up .

Their sake martini is wonderful .
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
fine dining restaurant quality .
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .

I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .

Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .

Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a &apos; special &apos; bagel experience .
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave .
What generous portions !
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .

Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these , and you &apos;ve broken even .

And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles &apos; heel .

Joe &apos;s Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it .
Try the Pad Thai , it &apos;s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
The price very reasonable .
Dessert - can &apos;t be missed , so save room ! ! !
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .

Their Margarita is best I &apos;ve had since I &apos;ve returned from Naples !
The tastes makes your mouth water for more .
