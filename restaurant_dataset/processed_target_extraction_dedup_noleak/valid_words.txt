I look forward to eating here again
Great food , great lay out and awesome service .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
Their Margarita is best I &apos;ve had since I &apos;ve returned from Naples !
The fried rice is amazing here .
The food is amazing ! ! ! !
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
The entire dining experience was wonderful !
Leon Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .
We started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective !
We began with the cheese fondue ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa apples and kielbasa to dip .
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo @-@ chinese food .
Food Food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables .
The Italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the UES ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 &apos;s , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...
Disappointing food , lousy service .
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
Ess @-@ A @-@ Bagel ( either by Sty @-@ town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb food at reasonable prices , La Villa can &apos;t be beat .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
I &apos;ve been to Naples 45 for dinner twice .
It &apos;s easy to get a table for a large group and you don &apos;t get hustled out .
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal .
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you &apos;ll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you &apos;re in .
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
Other apetizers and food
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don &apos;t like .
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .
The food is great and authentic .
So , for good food i &apos;d recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
The bruschetta and panini &apos;s are so yummy !
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
It &apos;s simply the best meal in NYC .
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .
The pizza is good though .
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini &apos;s .....
However , I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling .
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .
Once you step into Cosette , you &apos;re miraculously in a small , off @-@ the @-@ beaten path Parisian bistro .
The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .
I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch .
He takes real pride in his food and his business .
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer beer .
But , they were too big for the bun .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
Fish was overdone .
The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff .
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well .
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .
Service here was great , food was fantastic .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
at night , but it &apos;s hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous .
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .
The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no ambience at all .
The food at this place is &apos;gourmet &apos; Indian cuisine .
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .
Just because it &apos;s cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .
If you love seafood , you would love this place !
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food doesn &apos;t quite match up .
Service was very friendly .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
It is set far from the small street it &apos;s on , and there is no traffic noise .
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno @-@ lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish &apos;s sweetness .
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we hadn &apos;t even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
Plain and simple it &apos;s bad thai food .
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
Went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they &apos;ve skipped my order .
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly @-@ ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
Guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , didn &apos;t much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .
Every course was better than the next .
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , I felt there was more than enough food .
I &apos;ve been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST .
Service is top notch .
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .
The decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .
I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or Tofu plates .
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
Service Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka . )
The place was quiet and delightful .
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout , BUT service terrible .
The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .
The specials are usually quite good too .
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza place with good pizza .
The prices are wonderfully low .
Great sushi experience .
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
Try the Pad Thai , it &apos;s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
This quaint and romantic trattoria trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .
It &apos;s super @-@ trendy and there &apos;s always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence .
I / we will never go back to this place again .
One of us actually liked the expresso - that &apos;s it .
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .
The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food .
skip dessert .
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .
and you can &apos;t beat the prices .
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
The design and atmosphere is just as good .
Seating is ok even though sometimes there &apos;s alot of people .
Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) .
The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .
The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .
Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
We had Pam &apos;s special fried fish and it was amazing .
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan .
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs BBQ ribs in the city .
Food is great .
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can &apos;t remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull .
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , wasn &apos;t enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .
The meat dishes were only so @-@ so .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
The food is usually good but it certainly isn &apos;t a relaxing place to go .
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel .
Even if the food wasn &apos;t this good , the garden food wasn &apos;t this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) didn &apos;t come with anything like chips or a side .
They used shredded cheese on top !
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
The cuisine from what I &apos;ve gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I &apos;ve been accustomed to in Taipei .
The in @-@ house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef &apos;s tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines Chef &apos;s tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines .
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
They were such a rip @-@ off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn &apos;t even brought us a check yet !
I &apos;m happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .
Definite go if you &apos;re used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
I LOVED THE SHOWS .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
The setting is casual and romantic .
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
Check this place out !
Our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .
This wasn &apos;t the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) .
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting / atmosphere a lot .
When my husband and go there , we spend $ 60.00 ( have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more ) I can &apos;t say any more , it a place you &apos;ll never forget If you never go , you &apos;ll miss A Meal LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more ) I can &apos;t say any more , it a place you &apos;ll never forget If you never go , you &apos;ll miss A Meal of your life time
We were fans of the half @-@ price Saturday night option until some inedible squid half @-@ price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
In fact , two people could really share one plate .
He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN !
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire .
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
Great value for the quality ingredients .
Some baby pizzas get their wish .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service good and bad service .
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2 @-@ 3 entrees .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
The mussles were the fishiest things I &apos;ve ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
The food was boring and expensive .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
it &apos;s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
The sushi is also great !
Also , the sandwiches sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) didn &apos;t come with anything like chips or a side .
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .
We did have to wait at the bar for approx .
Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .
I have eaten there 3 @-@ 4 times and the food was always good .
While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous .
The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good , however .
I must say it &apos;s a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
Having discovered Ping &apos;s on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty .
I didn &apos;t take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
This place is great .
The combination of super @-@ fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them .
I liked the food at this quasi @-@ thai restaurant .
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
The Thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 .
Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
Save your money and don &apos;t waste your calories , go to Margharita &apos;s on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .
Not a large place , but it &apos;s cute and cozy .
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland .
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was INITIALLY fine .
After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just didn &apos;t know what the dish was supposed to taste like .
i would just ask for no oil next time .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
The decor is vibrant and eye @-@ pleasing with several semi @-@ private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .
It &apos;s definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
The food was very good , but not very thai .
The service is fantastic .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
It &apos;s a nice place to relax and have conversation .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly .
The sushi sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week &apos;s notice .
The dim sum however was very good .
I don &apos;t know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
I &apos;d call it an &apos; italian dinner &apos; .
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
The staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle @-@ light , food @-@ quality and service tables may be closely situated , the candle @-@ light , food @-@ quality and service overcompensate .
However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation .
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining .
I &apos;ve been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city .
This place is so much fun .
The first time the sushi sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
They didn &apos;t give us the dinner special until we asked for it .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
Price and quality of fish quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
Too bad the food wasn &apos;t of the same heritage .
So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
i recommend the thai popcorn : )
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence !
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
The food is yummy , especially their cooked @-@ to @-@ perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don &apos;t .
The food is very good for it &apos;s price , better than most fried dumplings I &apos;ve had .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
The food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
Anyways , if you &apos;re in the neighborhood to eat good food , I wouldn &apos;t waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
But they &apos;ve done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil @-@ brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil @-@ brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .
DO not try unless you &apos;re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .
Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
The Thai food is good .
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
I noted it was crossed off on the bill .
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food .
Delivery is fast too .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut @-@ down .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
Service was slow , but the people were friendly .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
When he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn &apos;t find tonic .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
When we notified him that he didn &apos;t mention the specials , he didn &apos;t apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients don &apos;t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
Wasn &apos;t going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery @-@ clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good !
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
Drinks way over priced .
It was nice and fresh , but I can &apos;t give it high scores on being authentic thai .
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it &apos;s wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .
His wife Tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I &apos;ve tried similar dishes at .
The food food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
The menu choices are similar but the taste menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
As a long @-@ time patron of Mamoun &apos;s , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city .
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
bottles of wine bottles of wine are cheap and good .
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we &apos;ve ever had ! !
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
Stick to the gulab jamun .
Winnie and her staff Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
The food was absolutely horrible !
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
Delicious crab cakes too .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick @-@ ass roti .
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
However , if you want great food at a great price and don &apos;t mind the decor food at a great price and don &apos;t mind the decor , you can &apos;t beat this place .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi &apos;s .
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
If presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works .
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) .
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit .
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand @-@ crafted beers .
Service was quick .
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
This is a wonderful place place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
Very excited to hear that short @-@ term Chef Jason Narone has moved on , he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record .
If you &apos;re looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet @-@ n @-@ tart and order yourself a hong @-@ kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) .
Spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .
They &apos;re also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny .
Service was also very good .
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no ...
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
A + + The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
This is the BEST Shabu @-@ Shabu Restaurant in the Try @-@ State Area .
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I wouldn &apos;t recommend to my American friends as it &apos;s very spicy .
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15 @-@ 20 minutes as the hosting staff reservations but expect to be delayed 15 @-@ 20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz &apos;s has a charm about it .
Have frequented &apos; ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I &apos;ve ever had ) .
Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre @-@ theater menu that is outstanding .
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
This place is incredibly tiny .
I &apos;m partial to the Gnocchi .
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished .
I would highly recommend Nina &apos;s to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .
not the food , not the ambiance , not the service , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC .
Try the lasagnette appetizer .
The food &apos;s as good as ever .
we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan .
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
Thank You Emilio .
Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?
We had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
Okay service .
The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self @-@ respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that can &apos;t be beat !
We won &apos;t go to this place again for a good meal .
Upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .
believe us , we &apos;ve been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who &apos;ve actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .
I like Mamoun &apos;s food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
Overall , excellent restaurant !
black white shakes came out good also .
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
Won &apos;t or Can &apos;t is not in the service directory .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that &apos;s the cheff gives to the food .
Yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations .
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I don &apos;t need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait @-@ staff who don &apos;t recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management diner , clumsy service , and management that doesn &apos;t care .
Don &apos;t go alone---even two people isn &apos;t enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods .
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a &apos; special &apos; bagel experience .
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co @-@ workers or friends that you haven &apos;t seen in a while .
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
The service is descent even when this small place is packed .
big and soft as well as good lunch food .
Very good wine choices .
Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
I absolutely Loved this place .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens &apos; biggest secret !
Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
The fried rice is really good too .
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !
Only drawback - they won &apos;t toast your bagel , and they don &apos;t make eggs for the bagel .
IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT .
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn &apos;t try to overpack the rice .
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .
Much more reasonably priced too !
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !
I &apos;ve had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken .
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
Wine list is not huge but def well selected .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well .
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
Unfortunately , the food was NOT something to get worked up about .
A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa eat for NYC , but not for dosa .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
Authentic Pakistani food .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
The sides were ok and incredibly salty .
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
What generous portions !
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
The service is spotty , sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there .
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
The service was attentive , yet discreet .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma &apos;s Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
very good breads as well .
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin @-@ crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese thin @-@ crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I &apos;d never heard of before .
And even with it &apos;s Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
A wonderful place !
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
Good drink .
They do cater to American palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
If you &apos;re craving for Haru &apos;s great food , especially the House Roll , but can &apos;t stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .
A must for all the Dosa lovers .
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .
Stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food .
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
Great bagels made the old @-@ fashioned way .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar @-@ soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .
For many people , this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic .
I have been to Roth &apos;s twice and both times were very disappointing .
The place was nice and calm .
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles &apos; heel .
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
But don &apos;t ever order bacon late at nite ( either platter or in sandwiches , for that matter don &apos;t from any take out place ) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars .
The food was actually aweful .
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
This place is a great bargain .
Zero ambiance to boot .
The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .
Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine dining experience with quality food and wine .
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12 @-@ 14 entrees .
The food was bland oily .
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .
Any if you have a reservation you &apos;ll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar .
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .
I &apos;m glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don &apos;t like .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
Apparently , the good cook works then .
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauc e and salmon caserole .
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
it &apos;s a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I &apos;d drink popcorn topping before I &apos;d eat another one of these .
This place must have cost the owners cost the owners afortune to build .
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .
At 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just cannot go wrong .
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there .
Food and service was okay .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
There is a downside if you &apos;re ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle @-@ light , food -quality and service tables may be closely situated , the candle @-@ light , food @-@ quality and service overcompensate .
But they don &apos;t have a toaster , which is strange .
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .
My fav was the sassy lassi ...
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !
Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .
The food was exceptional .
Also good for client lunch meetings , esp .
No refills on fountain drinks , though .
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
The wine list is also really nice .
The staff offers impeccable service .
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .
Avoid this place !
The waiter was attentive .
I haven &apos;t eat a lamb chop as delicious as that , the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
Don &apos;t eat here unless you &apos;re starving for thai food and you work next door .
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar guy at the bar .
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ @-@ ed and a spicy tuna roll serving almost 40 % of items BBQ @-@ ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not @-@ so @-@ fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
I was very impressed by this low @-@ key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine ! ! !
The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
The ambience was nice , but service wasn &apos;t so great .
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share .
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
As for the bar , this is another bad idea .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre reservation and the maitre d &apos; apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes dishes average at best and too expensive .
Sauce was watery and the food didn &apos;t have much flavor .
The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you &apos;ll need no more .
Little Tonino &apos;s is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
Great bar , most gorgeous bartenders you &apos;ve ever seen ( specifically the blond lady ) .
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .
May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
We had great desserts ( including the best cannoli I &apos;ve ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there &apos;s more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it &apos;s fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food food was overated and on the pricey side .
Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
Light , refreshing summer rolls ( not fried ) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll .. .
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner .
Planet Thai is great !
We actually gave 10 % tip ( which we have never done despite mediocre food and service tip ( which we have never done despite mediocre food and service ) , because we felt totally ripped off .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i &apos;ve ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .
The lamb meat was under @-@ cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY .
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes .
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar .
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...
Rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one
The food food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
The pizza was really good .
There are other people waiting !
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking .
also it &apos;s great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it &apos;s just perfect ... they &apos;re so frendly that we never want to live the place !
The seafood is amazing , there &apos;s a good wine list , and the ever @-@ changing menu always offers some great surprises .
The sushi was awful !
Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .
I &apos;ve rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I &apos;ve been going .
They forgot a sandwich , didn &apos;t include plastic forks , and didn &apos;t include pita with the hummus platter .
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
You should pass on the calamari .
Saturday , Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us .
The dim sum here is only so @-@ so .
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry .
And the prices were way to high for what you get .
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner dine for lunch or dinner .
While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city .
Great neighborhood joint .
The service was superb , they treat you like family .
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber .
I really liked this place .
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald &apos;s , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
At the end you &apos;re left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .
Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever @-@ changing menu keep us coming back .
