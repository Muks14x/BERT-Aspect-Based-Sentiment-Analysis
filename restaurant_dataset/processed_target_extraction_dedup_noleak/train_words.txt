Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
And the food was fantastic .
Good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) .
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) .
The staff has always been attentive and kind , and I &apos;ve always been amazed at how they &apos;ve handled all the various different group sizes that come in .
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz &apos;s Deli down on the Lower East Side .
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
limited menu , no @-@ so @-@ fresh ingredients , thinly @-@ sliced fish , fall @-@ apart rice .
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .
You can &apos;t go wrong with this place .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
They have authentic Indian Indian at amazin prices .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
The &apos; kamasutra &apos; and &apos; bombay cosmopolitan &apos; are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .
Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC .
Service was decent , but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation .
Because we didn &apos;t have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .
The wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they &apos;re going to be in town .
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .
Price and quality of fish fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
Try their chef &apos;s specials -- they are to die for .
The decor is very simple but comfortable .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5 : 30 on a week night without reservations .
The lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine ! !
I work near @-@ by , and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick @-@ cooked item .
The best burger I have had in the Village .
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
I thought this place was totally overrated .
I &apos;ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
Try green curry with vegetables .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like &apos; bar &apos; or &apos; pub &apos; .
If your visiting , you &apos;ll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it &apos;s in Time Sq ...
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .
Its worth the wait though .
I don &apos;t know about you guys , but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere .
Good bagels and good cream cheese .
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area .
Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .
love the food .
I care more about the food and ambience .
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don &apos;t skimp .
The pizza pizza was pretty good and huge .
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu menu .
For dinner I had the chicken tikka @-@ masala and some garlic naan dinner I had the chicken tikka @-@ masala and some garlic naan .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I can &apos;t wait !
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 .
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .
Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
As a Japanese native , I &apos;ve lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .
I had never had Edamame pureed Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could &apos;ve used a bit more salt ) .
So if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at Montparnasse , go early for the pre @-@ theater prix @-@ fixe .
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
I was back @-@ to @-@ back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
Service is not what you are coming here for ...
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .
We had the pot @-@ stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
people are rude bit again it &apos;s new york !
The staff is courteous and friendly .
Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
Bill a little high , but worth it .
I love the atmorphere @ peep !
The food now is inconsistent .
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts .
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that &apos;s just it -- the PAST !
This is a great place to take out @-@ of @-@ towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
Check out the secret back room .
Food was okay , nothing great .
Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
My husband said he could &apos;ve eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
Try the tandoori salmon !
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York .
Very popular style Izakaya ( Sake and small portion of sake @-@ friendly dishes portion of sake @-@ friendly dishes ) .
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city .
Southern Indian cuisine is still there , too .
Don &apos;t expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
I had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , I &apos;m a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries ) .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x .
I &apos;ve been to at Cafe Spice probably 5 @-@ 8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
$ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places quality - I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to .
My biggest complaint was the un @-@ tasty food although presented well .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria &apos;s .
even the wine by the glass was good .
Compared to Ess @-@ a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
The waitstaff are all very busy , it &apos;s not outstanding service , but I &apos;ve never been dealt with rudely .
It &apos;s just O.K. pizza .
The service is awful--the last time I was there ( and I do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .
Wine list selection is good and wine @-@ by @-@ the @-@ glass was generously filled to the top .
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .
It &apos;s constantly open , catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St. , so there &apos;s more turnover with the food than you &apos;d expect ( i.e. , surprisingly fresh ) .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
He offers subpar service and has no personality .
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses .
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation @-@ Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil wild mushroom ( third generation @-@ Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest .
Service was prompt and courteous .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter &apos;s Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad Peter &apos;s Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
Nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale Italian decor .
from an English speaking staff .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid @-@ back late night in the city .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
I &apos;ve had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer .
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .
I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn &apos;t as good .
The service is outstanding and my crab @-@ cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
If you don &apos;t mind pre @-@ sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
now if they could only get a toaster .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived .
I will go back to Suan soon !
i don &apos;t usually order wine with indian so i can &apos;t comment on their wine list or their wines .
The entree entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
You can get a completely delish martini martini martini in a glass ( that &apos;s about 2 1 / 2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .
The food is great and reasonably priced .
Both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise rush and the wait and the noise ( which isn &apos;t actually that bad ) , I mean please , who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic ?
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
I can &apos;t believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
I LOVE their Thai
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong .
The anti @-@ pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
People are always friendly .
I didn &apos;t complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
Yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
Their coffee is quite good too !
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .
If you &apos;d like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
Don &apos;t waste money on decor .
Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .
The sandwiches sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .
The pizza here is delicious .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they don &apos;t toast !
The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
Don &apos;t judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
I almost wanted to write a bad review , so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself !
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy .
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
Decor is charming .
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
the food was undercooked @-@ the sauce watery , and the vegetables sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
I &apos;m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we &apos;re repeat customers .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
This food is asian @-@ air fusion .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service place place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it &apos;s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can &apos;t seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
Really though , where &apos;s the seasoning ?
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you &apos;ll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
From the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly I might add ) .
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever .
Lahore is a great place to duck into late @-@ night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you &apos;ll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza flour , makes this is one of the better pizza &apos;s in NY .
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I &apos;m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino &apos;s blows my families receipies away .
And where does Patis go wrong ; no where .
In summer @-@ eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) ! ! !
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
Add to that great service and great food food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
The menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious .
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub @-@ par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .
For the quality of food , a little too expensive .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .
fresh restaurant was amazing ........ food was delicious and of course fresh .
Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there &apos;s still a large number of vegetarian @-@ friendly choices .
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
delicious simple food food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
I go back in line like three times on average until I can &apos;t walk anymore .
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .
Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy corner booth table place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
The atmosphere isn &apos;t the greatest , but I suppose that &apos;s how they keep the prices down .
I &apos;ve lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .
The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible .
We couldn &apos;t carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we &apos;re taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
The wine the service was very good too .
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
And the bill was outragous .
I &apos;ve overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I &apos;ve been sitting there while he lectured another customer .
Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit @-@ inducing , YUCK .
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding .
if this happens , just ask for real naan .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take @-@ out pizza .
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique @-@ seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert portions very small , including dessert .
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken Chinese food is General Tao chicken , then this is NOT your place .
We ate outside at Haru &apos;s Sake bar because Haru &apos;s restaurant next door was overflowing .
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food .
I &apos;ve had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers .
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
THe Pizza and wine were excellent @-@ the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .
As much as I like the food there , I can &apos;t bring myself to go back .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
but the service was a bit slow .
Why make a reservation if you aren &apos;t going to keep it ?
We ate here in March , 2006 and ordered the pre @-@ theatre 3 @-@ course dinner with wine flight .
The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
Service was on par but not wonderful .
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
You cannot go wrong with this place .
Just stick with the small dishes !
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties ( multiples of 2 and higher ) seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small 2 @-@ person table .
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
The location is perfect .
Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet .
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .
The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better . ! !
When you want a piece of beef , head on over .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not @-@ so @-@ little gem does , it amazing he &apos;s even able to remember a consistent but not @-@ so @-@ frequent visitor .
The prices were fantastic .
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you don &apos;t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
We did tip , I guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
try the spicy shrimp appetizer ( again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price ) and the lamb vindaloo is great .
The food was absolutely amazing ! !
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
What a great place .
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don &apos;t have to deal with crowds or lines crowds or lines .
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
Joe &apos;s Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
However , they &apos;ve got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me .
Just straight up cheap , good food .
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !
Not a small feat for good french food in the area .
The ambience is very calm and quiet .
though the service could be better ( possibly due to more than one very large group in the house ) , it is very cordial and warm , as is the general clientele .
Good luck getting a table .
Hats off to the chef .
Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for NYC .
The food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .
If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share , Kai may not be the best option .
Its a go @-@ to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests .
My friend &apos;s food was also the complete opposite of what it &apos;s supposed to taste like ( aND look like ) .
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
They &apos;ve the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
The food options rule .
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! ..
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .
The main downside to the place is the nazi @-@ like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
The Pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , I &apos;ve had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde !
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a &apos; special&apos; bagel experience .
I don &apos;t like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable .
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .
Here &apos;s to the fake fish tanks too ...
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .
Simply some good tasting Chinese food Chinese food at incredible prices ...
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food !
What I didn &apos;t like was how the food came right after it was ordered .
Monday nights are a bargain at the $ 28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus * three * glasses of wine paired with each course .
This place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
It &apos;s like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
Try the green curry ! ! !
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
The food is good , I can &apos;t lie .
I went to Del Frisco &apos;s Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8 : 00 reservation .
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .
I went at 6 : 00 PM specifically for the pre @-@ theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .
Overall , I &apos;m still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .
Did I mention the wine ?
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat .
The only thing the waiters don &apos;t do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of .
The food is very good too but for the most part , it &apos;s just regular food , nothing special .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the dish lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small .
Definitely not worth the price !
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn &apos;t a problem to get our table immediately .
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
It &apos;s really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
For the location , the prices location , the prices are very reasonable .
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand .
If it &apos;s just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery &apos;s ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .
Rao &apos;s has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
This place has the best interior place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W &apos;burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b / c I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .
This is some really good , inexpensive sushi .
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( Anywhere ) .
What an amazing meal and experience !
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
this is the best secret place in midtown &apos; , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .
I won &apos;t go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter served while in line a bannan fritter .
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water .
After the main course came , we didn &apos;t see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
Probably much busier for lunch , it &apos;s seldom crowded for dinner ( too close to downtown ) .
Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) .
Fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions .
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .
Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
The service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I &apos;m willing to overlook it .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
we love th pink pony .
Ballato &apos;s is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it &apos;s in the West Village .
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
Has the chef and owner changed ? ? ?
the food is decent .
Whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were .
The bagels are fabulous .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food food food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it &apos;s always good .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions .
Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .
I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds .
While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .
Service is great , takeout is good too .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn &apos;t even fully melted !
the drinks drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
One would think we &apos;d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter wouldn &apos;t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef check a chef appeared to usher us out .
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
The people with carts of food don &apos;t understand you because they don &apos;t speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food people with carts of food don &apos;t understand you because they don &apos;t speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the &quot; free &quot; appetizer of olives was disappointing .
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I &apos;m not sure which dim sum dish it was .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
Best Reuben sandwich ever !
Priced at upper intermediate range .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .
After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !
Service has always been friendly and efficient .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off @-@ set by the pour @-@ your @-@ own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
All conveniently delivered right to the door .
The staff staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Good , because hey , it &apos;s more food , but bad because dim sum food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
Get the tuna of gari .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
But the pizza is way to expensive .
Horrible food and Horrible service .
The flavors robust and subtle .
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
The food is excellent !
The food there are sastifying .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
Not too crazy about their sake martini .
They don &apos;t walk around with the trays of Dim Sum .
The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
The service was great as well .
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3 @-@ 6 each ) .
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
The atmosphere is great ! ! !
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi wasn &apos;t fresh .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre @-@ theatre or after @-@ theatre drinks !
A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
I have been to Rao &apos;s probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you don &apos;t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
Appetizers are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
Decent wine selection too .
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it &apos;s a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don &apos;t hesitate to ask for help with what to get .
Fast service .
Their sake martini is wonderful .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods MSG cooking in the foods .
Will have to return to try the chocolate !
I stumbled upon this second floor walk @-@ up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce .
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
The worst excuse for Japanese food I &apos;ve ever encountered .
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people .
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it .
great food , lt &apos;s of it , more then one person can eat !
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
All of the pizzas pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
No you &apos;re going to go back because the food was good .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
This place is always packed .
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food .
The food was spicy and delicious .
Located at the end of a magnificent block .
Waiters are slow but sweet .
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , won &apos;t put your wallet out of commission .
Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you won &apos;t be disappointed .
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we &apos;ve ever had .
The fries are yummy .
Try the Pad Se @-@ Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .
We left after one drink .
The food is delicious .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
Be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .
Spreads and toppings Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .
The place is so cool and the service place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
Try the hot dogs too , they &apos;re snappy and delicious .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some food ?
For the price , you cannot eat this well in Manhattan .
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
The service was typical short @-@ order , dinner type .
Plus they made a perfect martini .
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I &apos;d go out in Manhattan .
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
I liked the beer selection !
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
Tiny dessert dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
I &apos;ve read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food .
Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .
Once for dinner and once for brunch .
It &apos;s not mind @-@ blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside @-@ out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that &apos;s not just from the rice .
I was with a party of 7 ( close but not next the the front doors ) and we were eating with our coats on .
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
Be careful of portions - they &apos;re HUGE .
One would think we &apos;d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter wouldn &apos;t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 &apos;s .
This place , however , has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above @-@ average .
Again , the waitress was awesome .
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price can &apos;t be beat ! ! !
The service is ok but could be better .
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
This place is not worth the prices .
The food is expensive , but worth every bite .
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it &apos;s still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner place to enjoy a nice dinner .
The space is a bit too small for live music space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
If it isn &apos;t for the food ( A + + + ) , it must be the service or the ambience .
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these , and you &apos;ve broken even .
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can &apos;t wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo .
Pizza was a little soggy .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
The one vegetarian entree ( Abby &apos;s treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
It &apos;s all about the food ! !
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it &apos;s lovely atmosphere entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it &apos;s lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .
If you &apos;ve ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
I &apos;ve been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I &apos;m craving for Pho , Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice , this is the place to go .
Service - friendly and attentive .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
A restaurant that doesn &apos;t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
So I &apos;ve never actually been to M proper , but I &apos;ve had it delivered a few times .
The wine list is excellent .
Moderate prices .
Food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .
From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot doesn &apos;t miss a beat .
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
if you &apos;re daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it &apos;s wonderful !
The service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .
Staff is very accomodating .
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out @-@ of @-@ town .
Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .
great eats , good times .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
Grilled whole fish wonderful , great spicing .
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
I grew up on these bagels .
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .
NO PIZZA 33 for me !
The dinner menu is diverse and top @-@ notch as well .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby waiting in the lobby .
In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you can &apos;t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests .
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
The noodle and rices dishes taste great .
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
Overall , the best bagel in town .
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant resturant .
The service was attentive .
While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I &apos;m not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you &apos;ll love it here .
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up .
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC !
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
Great wine list , reasonably priced .--Sara
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .
The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu @-@ fare , the dishes specials to the regular menu @-@ fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
I &apos;ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare cheese and delicious french fare , you &apos;ll love Artisanal !
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it &apos;s one of my favorite dishes .
Even after getting pushed out by the no @-@ class Famous Ray &apos;s , Sal has risen again to carry on his father &apos;s uncle &apos;s legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let &apos;s not forget the Outstanding Pizza !
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
As I made the title , it &apos;s an affordable restaurant for great taste .
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
But the coconut rice was good .
During our meal , the management meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald &apos;s than this joint .
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice @-@ 1 for our order and 2 @-@ for our check .
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .
Order the panang duck , it &apos;s fantastic .
The bagel was huge .
Not only was the food outstanding , but the little &apos; perks &apos; were great .
Not worth the prices .
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza selection of thin crust pizza pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .
I think I &apos;ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
I loved this place ! !
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef ( usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt ) .
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish .
The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side .
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .
The Prix Fixe menu Prix Fixe menu Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
go here for the drinks !
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you &apos;ll love it here .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .
We didn &apos;t get drink refills and she didn &apos;t even offer us the option of dessert .
Jimmy &apos;s is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
The highly spiced chai tea was great too .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
Not impressed with the food .
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre @-@ theatre or after @-@ theatre drinks spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre @-@ theatre or after @-@ theatre drinks !
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT &apos;s .
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .
Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it &apos;s great .
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !
What a great place !
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it &apos;s a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty .
The decor is vibrant and eye @-@ pleasing with several semi @-@ private boths on the right side of the dining hall semi @-@ private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef &apos;s passion ( and kitchen &apos;s precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups kitchen cuisine - chef &apos;s passion ( and kitchen &apos;s precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .
If you go for the pre @-@ theatre menu , it &apos;s an even greater deal .
The pasta penne pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest .. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol
I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .
Tiny dessert dessert dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz ( the chilaquiles jazz brunch with great live jazz ( the chilaquiles were awesome !
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
The staff is excellent , specjal : that girl behind the bar , european chic .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
The decor in this place is very diner @-@ ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy !
The all @-@ Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start .
Thanks Bloom &apos;s for a lovely trip .
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
The menu is nothing like the one on the website .
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
Very romantic fires - I &apos;ve literally spent hours at Lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience wine and enjoying the ambience .
His drinks are very inventive , delicious and classy .
Two words : Free wine .
The menu has so many fish items and oysters .
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
Get your food to go , find a bench , and kick back with a plate of dumplings .
Late nite omelletes are not good here , there is no variety !
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn &apos;t seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non @-@ busy night ( for the coat check girls ) .
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
The filet mignon dish was superb !
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
This is some really good , inexpensive sushi sushi .
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .
Acceptable prices .
The lobster sandwich lobster sandwich lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over @-@ bearing or rushed .
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .
Amma is nothing special .
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top @-@ notch .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
The bagels bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you &apos;ll love it here .
There &apos;s something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
I &apos;ve waited over one hour for food .
Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co @-@ workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines wines at reasonable prices .
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant .
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you &apos;re in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food food , cheaply @-@ priced , generally friendly staff , and if you &apos;re a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue Rice Avenue Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ..... very Soho / Village / Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on Roosevelt Avenue !
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we &apos;re not in a hurry .
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they &apos;d treat us well for the occasion .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal .
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I &apos;ve had .
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn &apos;t believe the food .
Good food .
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and couldn &apos;t get a table .
Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta portion ) and pasta was fresh and well @-@ prepared .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely .
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
Even if the food wasn &apos;t this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
To my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re @-@ set a table for six .
Faan is sooo good .
We had a girls &apos; night dinner here for restaurant week .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue .
Dessert is a joke ... dont bother
Overall I was impressed and will return , it &apos;s a great QPR ( Quality to Price Quality to Price Ratio ) .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro @-@ type vibe .
The music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as I did , I got a whiff of corriander .
This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .
My husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .
After dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor , probably one of the biggest you &apos;ll see in NY .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave .
And really large portions .
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
Food is excellent .
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza .
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart &apos;s and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .
I need at least three rolls to be full , and that &apos;s at least $ 14.00 !
I would highly recommend this place !
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
It won &apos;t break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food .
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .
However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
The dim sum is ok but doesn &apos;t taste that fresh , and the little dishes don &apos;t look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
I couldn &apos;t reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
All of my co @-@ workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn &apos;t heard about this place .
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6 @-@ 8 pieces .
The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it &apos;s on the menu or not .
While the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge .
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .
Decor leaves something to be desired .
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
Made my dining experience uncomfortable .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
There was no ambiance .
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8 : 00 pm curtain call .
Most importantly , food is excellent .
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion .. try the potato stuff kanish best one .
Excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .
Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .
There are much better places in NY with better prices .
The food was good .
The crispy chicken wasn &apos;t for us , though .
They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce topping , sauce and etc .
Our friendly server made great food suggestions server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
Service is average .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple @-@ decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably @-@ sized portion ( and price portion ( and price ) .
We all ate pasta entre &apos;es , which were great .
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here .
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you &apos;re eating in a freindly little european town .
We &apos;ve been following chef Lyle &apos;s food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare chef Lyle &apos;s food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !
We parked on the block of Nina &apos;s the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .
Toons has recently been redone , so it &apos;s now a very attractive space .
The staff isn &apos;t the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
I &apos;ve lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place ( except in a really bad dream ) .
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice @-@ all the dishes are manna from heaven .
Food was average but tasty .
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
Salads were fantastic .
Try the sea bass .
Fantastic place .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT , MODERN , YET COZY .
Last time I went here , the waitress didn &apos;t come back after taking our order .
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
If you &apos;re not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don &apos;t accept credit cards .
If you go , try the marinara / arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm ..... everything is just delicious .
You order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience .
You must try the shrimp appetizers .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
All the food was hot tasty .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart &apos;s for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it .
Then , get ripped on free box wine .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not @-@ so @-@ little gem does , it amazing he &apos;s even able to remember a consistent but not @-@ so @-@ frequent visitor .
Lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .
Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .
The place wasn &apos;t too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .
Threw my fiance &apos;s surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn &apos;t be happier .
They are the best bagels I &apos;ve had .
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
When he &apos;s not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he &apos;s visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers .
The menu has lots of options : I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you .
After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I &apos;ve found little toninos .
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch - I dont mind .
Service was very good and warm .
Dessert - can &apos;t be missed , so save room ! ! !
The dosas dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I &apos;d drink popcorn topping before I &apos;d eat another one of these .
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
You can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC .
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
This isn &apos;t your corner Chinese food takeout .
I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !
We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
( The asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! )
They have some great entrees here as well .
Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .
I &apos;d highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
We went around 9 : 30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
It cannot be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
Besides , when you have bad service , that &apos;s less money you have to tip .
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .
As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit .
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired &apos; doneness &apos; accompanied by salads and sides that don &apos;t look like leafy road kill .
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
Great bagels bagels made the old @-@ fashioned way .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
The lobster sandwich lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto -yum ! ) .
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
The restaurant is cute but not upscale .
Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .
The food food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you &apos;ll like it !
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
The price very reasonable .
For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .
No free drink .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .
Baluchi &apos;s has solid food and a nice decor Baluchi &apos;s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
This place is always very crowded and popular .
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
those rolls rolls were big , but not good and sashimi wasn &apos;t fresh .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .
I wasn &apos;t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that &apos;s the price you pay for a popular place .
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .
If you go to Roth &apos;s try to be served by Mike , he is GREAT ! !
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
Behind this counter , two men are squeezed in .
fine dining restaurant quality .
It &apos;s boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
Took my mom for Mother &apos;s Day , and the maitre d&apos; was pretty rude .
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
Killer Sushi !
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
The rest of the dim sum dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
Cute place , nice wait staff place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
There is usually a wait but it is well worth it .
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne price , and the house champagne is a great value .
Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .
Great food , great prices , great service .
Good , fast service .
Total hipster @-@ wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .
The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .
As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling .
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad .
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel .
This is a fun restaurant to go to .
All the staff is absolutely professional ! !
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ?
uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison .
Why do people rave about the ambience .
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .
An excellent service
The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it &apos;s never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe &apos;s .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
The food is consistently wonderful - I &apos;ve been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu @-@ Shabu .
The pizza pizza is overpriced and soggy .
I got the $ 10 10 @-@ piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt &apos;s house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent .
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food ( all fast foods in my opinion ) .
We had reservations at 9pm , but was not seated until 10 : 15pm .
Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she &apos;s @-@ way @-@ cuter @-@ than @-@ me @-@ that @-@ b @ # $ * way ) .
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I &apos;m eating indian cuisine .
To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
They don &apos;t seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .
It &apos;s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers .
Their sushi , Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented .
Don &apos;t miss Bloom &apos;s on your next trip to Manhatten .
They couldn &apos;t even make a salad that was appealing .
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
We were a group of 8 and well seved .
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic .
The staff is no nonsense .
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
the all @-@ u @-@ can @-@ eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
I &apos;ve dined at Alain Ducasse &apos;s restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining price for the same excellent dining experience .
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you &apos;re with .
Also , don &apos;t plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it &apos;s not on the menu , you can &apos;t have it .
While the menu isn &apos;t especially groundbreaking , everything I &apos;ve tried so far has been well @-@ executed and tasty .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn &apos;t miss roxy , s food is expensive but it &apos;s new york !
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
I would recommend Roxy &apos;s for that , but not for their food .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
The only concern i have is with the slighly all @-@ business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
Food -awesome .
Staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
Great food , great decor , great service .
Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
You have to increase the service a lot .
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
This was the worst dining experience I &apos;ve ever had .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
The food was authentic .
Oh , don &apos;t even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
The Dim Sum was so @-@ so , but not spectacular .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non @-@ intrusive .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $ 12 dollars and the mushrooms where $ 12 for about 1oz .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
We ordered the chicken casserole chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
The pickles were great addition .
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up wasn &apos;t too bad .
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
While this isn &apos;t classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn @-@ outs .
Wouldn &apos;t recomend it for dinner !
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
It &apos;s a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
Also , the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected , but a truly above and beyond thing to do ...
For two people with tip was less than $ 25 bucks .
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
The wine list is extensive and impressive .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
This place doesn &apos;t compare with Mamoun &apos;s in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that &apos;s just my opinion .
For years , I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best , but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
Just straight up cheap , good food food .
Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not @-@ trying @-@ too @-@ hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
I &apos;m no food critic , but I &apos;d like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .
The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee ! !
The prices cannot be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste .
Went there for an office lunch .
My suggestion is to eat family style because you &apos;ll want to try the other dishes eat family style because you &apos;ll want to try the other dishes .
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .
if you &apos;re looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here - if you &apos;re looking for interesting combinations , try sushi of gari &apos;s ( east side ) .
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I couldn &apos;t help telling them that the food menu , and I couldn &apos;t help telling them that the food was horrible .
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced .
We were disappointed with the pre @-@ fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte .
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .
Authentic Taiwanese food Taiwanese food that &apos;s cheap ... what more could you ask for ?
It &apos;s also attached to Angel &apos;s Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ...
I loved everythig about it @-@ especially the shows and actors .
It appears to be the owner &apos;s first venture and it shows .
The best pad thai i &apos;ve ever had .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City .
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it &apos;s cool and the music is hear well there .
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren &apos;t as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ....
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
Try the cheesecake !
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
Taxan delicious !
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend .
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste dishes to get a decent taste .
Decent wine wine at reasonable prices .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks served us our food and drinks with a smile .
Raga &apos;s is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere isn &apos;t that bad either .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn &apos;t that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
Get the soup and a nosh ( pastrami sandwich ) for $ 8 and you &apos;re golden .
Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
Great service , great food .
We could not catch our waiter &apos;s eye , and he ignored us .
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .
It &apos;s the perfect restaurant for NY life style , it got cool design , awsome drinks and food and lot &apos;s of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar ...
They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon cheese ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .
Wine list Wine list is extensive without being over @-@ priced .
Wow over 100 beers to choose from .
Went for a late weekday lunch .
Despite the fact that the space is large , they &apos;ve overcrowded the floor with tables .
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
The food &apos;s dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine .
To sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
The food was great and the service was even better .
Cheese plate Cheese plate Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
the waitstaffs are nice though .
My turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
Great wine , great food .
The food was good too .
Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !
I take all my NYC guests to VT &apos;s .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it &apos;s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .
I was very disappointed with this restaurant .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
You don &apos;t go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ wall feeling of the place .
The food is great , service is ok .
Overall , not worth the money .
Last memorial day , I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend ( interesting , but ... ) .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
The burger was great , also .
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .
I can &apos;t wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
The food was great .
Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
More important , the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo .
The food was average to above @-@ average ; the French Onion soup French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .
The place is a lot of fun .
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish .
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you &apos;re seated you &apos;ll forget about everything except what &apos;s on your plate .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
However , if you want great food at a great price and don &apos;t mind the decor , you can &apos;t beat this place .
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you &apos;re into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz &apos; Deli , or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants .
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
Unique apppetizers .
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
The sandwhiches are out @-@ of @-@ this world !
Normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef &apos;s special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon chef &apos;s special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
the turkey burgers are scary !
The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available .
Really cool stauff inside .
The ceiling is amazing !
I wasn &apos;t there for the Half @-@ Price Saturday Night Special , but Tuesday Night .
The fried dumplings are GREAT !
Whether it &apos;s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
Try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato .
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
Even though its good seafood seafood , the prices are too high .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess didn &apos;t have my name .
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too .
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .
Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bijin ) , but pricy .
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .
The food is great .
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
The buffet had a nice selection .
Baluchi &apos;s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
It is also extremely well priced .
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
While the food was excellent , it wasn &apos;t cheap ( though not extremely expensive either ) .
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .
We only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered .
THe perfect spot .
the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
Great selection of wine , and seafood .
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( don &apos;t waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .
Great pizza for lunch place .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce Chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
The food however , is what one might expect .
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .
We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them .
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you &apos;ve had the tiramisu .
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
I have had so many dinners here and it &apos;s always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .
The food was very well prepared .
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
If you &apos;re looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco &apos;s !
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer bartender for the SEASONAL beer ! ! !
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze ( they told me that if I call in the order , they &apos;d bring it out to the car so I wouldn &apos;t have to look for parking ) .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy .
So all I &apos;m trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I &apos;ve ever been to .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
The fish was really , really fresh .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
I &apos;m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I didn &apos;t just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
Food Food is great and inexpensive .
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .
But who says Murray &apos;s is anything about service .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well @-@ prepared .
Slightly above average wines wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
The sauces used are also not that exciting .
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food .
I have never had cheescake like this .
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12- $ 15 per meal , I &apos;d like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
This place is worth an one @-@ hour drive .
I like the ambience , it &apos;s very dark and original .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I &apos;m used to .
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well .
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
This is the kind of place you &apos;d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
Over price , and small portions .
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese .... both very tasty .
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza .
Great vibe , lots of people .
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .
The food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .
Waitstaff are very friendly .
If you live in new york city , you &apos;ll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
service was efficient courteous .
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai ( more modern and sleek ) .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
Great staff .
I always get the Shabu @-@ Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .
Prices are very good .
I think the stuff was better than Disney .
The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .
The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which wasn &apos;t listed but made for us upon request !
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they &apos;re very nice , and sometimes not .
The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually .
I absolutely love this place ! ! !
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well .
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we hadn &apos;t ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
It &apos;s a small cute restaurant .
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly .
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .
The pizza was great .
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could &apos;ve used a bit more salt ) .
$ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
I &apos;ve eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the cuisine .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
Fish is so very fresh .
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
Very good service and very good prices .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines priced wines .
Always popular , always full , always a wait .
Try the Pad Thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they &apos;re all delicious .
Skip this restaurant , it &apos;s a big disappointment .
My co @-@ workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service value for excellent sushi and service .
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chip s @-@ good but a far cry from what the name implies .
Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .
The anti @-@ pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains pasta mains .
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it .. very fortunate , location wise .
I didn &apos;t expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom &apos;s , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel &apos;s a run for its money .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
however , it &apos;s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
You can &apos;t say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt @-@ in @-@ your @-@ mouth experience ) .
The soup is pretty good too .
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .
This place is a great stop for great food .
No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
Sushi wasn &apos;t anything spectacular for the price .
It &apos;s a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service .
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did &apos;nt feel like finishing them .
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal priced meal .
Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .
The food was so @-@ so .
We didn &apos;t even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .
Service was good and food is wonderful .
Faan &apos;s got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
Service is fast and friendly .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten .
this little place has a cute interior decor place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
Great spot spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 .
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion main course was good to eat the portion would &apos;ve been fine for me .
This place place is not worth the prices .
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats eats - this is the place .
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for .
It &apos;s a rather cramped and busy restaurant restaurant and it closes early .
The exotic food exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
The food is nothing like its menu description .
Reasonable prices .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 3.00 in NYC .
Next time , we wouldn &apos;t dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .
The sushi is amazing ! ! !
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion .
It &apos;s a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single @-@ handedly solved third world famine .
The place &apos;s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad @-@ looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping &apos;s are clear as glass with healthy @-@ looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover &apos;s brunch .
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .
We &apos;ve been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
So , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .
The best Chicken pad tai , I &apos;ve ever had .
The service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
The service is awful .
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
Sure , the setting is nice .
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I don &apos;t need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait @-@ staff who don &apos;t recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that doesn &apos;t care .
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
The wine list wine list is interesting and has many good values .
They charge different prices all the time .
The food was just OK , I would never go back .
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
they didn &apos;t disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at Taj Mahal .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
The service is ok , some of the people didn &apos;t get what they asked for .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it &apos;s a very disappointing experience .
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
Quick and friendly service .
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .
Our food was great too !
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I &apos;ve had at this price range .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
The wine list isn &apos;t great , and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno &apos;s down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .
Have the iced tea .
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and / or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .
Love Pizza 33 ..
The owner truly caters to all your needs .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
Prices are in line .
The service was ok .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
Food doesn &apos;t appear to be cooked on premisis but there &apos;s a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch .
Always great service !
i &apos;ve been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they &apos;re that good .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn &apos;t feel rushed at all even though there was a wait .
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
Because of the delicate thin crust , take @-@ out pies crust , take @-@ out pies get soggy in their boxes .
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .
Only wine and beer are served , but the house varities served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
You are paying for the atmosphere , which is nice , but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge .
Check it out , it won &apos;t hurt your stomach or your wallet .
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
i &apos;ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .
We &apos;ve never had any problems with the staff but maybe we &apos;ve been lucky ?
Also , if you don &apos;t want to sit at a certain table , you don &apos;t have to !
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
I wouldn &apos;t even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .
It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that &apos;s the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .
Don &apos;t dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non @-@ veg selections .
The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .
I had the mango chicken and i can &apos;t go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .
In any event , this is a place I &apos;ll be sure to stop by again when I &apos;m in this part of town .
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot ! ! ! !
Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine &apos;s dinner .
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
If you can handle that , it &apos;s a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 .
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened .
The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food &apos;s presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices food &apos;s presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .
Great food at reasonable prices .
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .
While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service ) and lack of remorse .
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can &apos;t top the setting for a romantic dinner setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one .
The tastes makes your mouth water for more .
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .
Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant sushi fish overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas .
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .
We &apos;ve only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner .
All my co @-@ workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
Best dish is nori @-@ wrapped tuna dish is nori @-@ wrapped tuna .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
The food food is great and reasonably priced .
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch &apos;s editorial review .
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food wait in getting food at peak times .
less wait time for me !
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner .
but when we looked at the menu , there weren &apos;t a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list priced wine list .
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don &apos;t have to rush off to a show .
The staff is very kind and well trained , they &apos;re fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations .
The in @-@ house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music in @-@ house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
The spicy Tuna roll spicy Tuna roll spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I &apos;ve had at this price range .
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
Love YUKA .
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .
Three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous .
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price .
The food is good , but very expensive for the casualness of it .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
And , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .
The service is always bad though , don &apos;t expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .
Food is great and inexpensive .
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress cod e is relatively strict except on Fridays .
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert tables service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom &apos;s of course ) .
The food was very expensive ( we spent $ 160 for lunch for two ) but extremely tasty .
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
My wife had the fried shrimp fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make &apos; em worth eating .
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but couldn &apos;t make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
Bottom line : B + for the food , F for the service .
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality .
The lox is always fresh too .
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un @-@ appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un @-@ appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .
We didn &apos;t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .
Pizza here is consistently good .
The food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food doesn &apos;t quite match up .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
Spice is great Thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
When you &apos;re sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand @-@ painted high ceiling ) you &apos;d never know there was a world outside .
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price
Rao is a good restaurant , but it &apos;s nothing special .
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin @-@ crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I &apos;d never heard of before .
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it .
The counter service is bad .
It &apos;s charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .
Cute place , nice wait staff place place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
But that wasn &apos;t the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .
I &apos;ve had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .
I &apos;ve been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy &apos;s !
After a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .
Just don &apos;t take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer ! ! !
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name .
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat .
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
Delivery service is great too .
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .
Food is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi &apos;s tastes better .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
I had the best ravioli ever .
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .
